# FAF API specs

This repository contains API first specs of our application(s). Not all APIs can follow this approach as they are driven by other source (e.g. the faf-java-api spec is semi-automatically derived from the database schema).


We support schemas for HTTP ([OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org)) and messaging ([AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/en)).
